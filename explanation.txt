The first problem was that the script used the wrong file name and had no error handling. This was fixed by using the correct file name and adding a check to show a clear error if the file is missing.

The second problem was that duplicates were not actually removed because the method was not applied. This was fixed by using inplace=True so duplicates are removed properly.

The third problem was that the script created a new date column instead of converting the existing one. This was fixed by converting the transaction_date column directly.

The fourth problem was that the script kept negative quantities. This was fixed by keeping only rows where the quantity are positive.

The fifth problem was that total revenue was calculated by adding unit price and quantity. This was fixed by multiplying unit price by quantity.

The sixth problem was that revenue was grouped by product ID instead of product name. This was fixed by grouping by product name.
